Hi, this is ZHANG Tai. A full-time DevOps engineer(Jenkins Admin) living in Guangzhou, China.

I like to spend my spare time playing around with my homelab server and IoT devices.

My name in Chinese is 张泰. My given name was given by my grandma and I am very proud of it. It is too special to have a Hexagram symbol: ䷊, which means peace.
