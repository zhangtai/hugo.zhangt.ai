Just read the news that Fedora released 37, with the (almost) latest Linux kernel 6.0.7. That's very brave and new, I must try it!

I heard that you must upgrade your system for at most 9 months, and I think this is not a problem for me, I don't have any severe business running on any server, all my servers are dev-only.

The software packager `dnf` has a very new repo of packages, e.g. for `neovim` I can just run `dnf install neovim` and it will install the latest one to my system. I can't imagine when using Ubuntu.

## packages installed

- zsh
- neovim
- make cmake gcc-c++
- htop
- util-linux-user

After maybe 4 hours of using of the Fedora Desktop, I installed a server image instead to further checking the different to Ubuntu.
